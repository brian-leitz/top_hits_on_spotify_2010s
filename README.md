This project was an analysis on the Top Hits on Spotify from 2000-2019, the goal of this project was to analyze the dataset for relationships and correlations, as well as building visualizations and digging for insights as to what values drive the most popular songs within the dataset. 

Please note that this was a group project that I completed with two other group members.
